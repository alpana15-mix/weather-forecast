# ðŸŒ¦ Weather Forecast App

A simple, responsive weather forecast application built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It fetches real-time weather data from a weather API and displays it in a clean, easy-to-read interface.  
Built for learning, but works well enough to be genuinely useful.
